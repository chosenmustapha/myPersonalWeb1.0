MY personal website:
Stage: Underconstruction, alot of ingredient need to be added.
As of right it only consist of static stateless react component I created.
It's overkill for a static html and css project type of project.
However when it's all set and done the site would have some states to it. That's the reason why I am using react to build my functional components...
